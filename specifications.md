|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001              | Create offer               | As a user, I want to be able to start a new project offer so I can fill in the information    | the system should provide a clear way for the user to initiate a new project offer.                                         |
| FR002              | Adding a client            | As a user, I want to be able to either select an existing client to an offer or create a new one | there should be a field in the form that should allow me to either select an existing client from a list or a create a new one. the number of clients will be small initially. |
| FR003              | Adding one or more employee| As a user I want to be able to select which people of my team work on the project             | add an input to select people and add / or remove them from a list of possible team members                                 |
| FR004              | Select timeframe           | As a user, I want to be able to select whether the project is 2 weeks or 6 weeks.             | add an input field to select it.                                                                                            |
| FR005              | Upload Requirements File   | As a user, I want to be able to upload a markdown requirement file.                           | add a file upload for markdown files. assume they are correct so only check the ending and limit the file size initially to 1 MB |
| FR006              | Add multiplier / discount  | As a user, I want to be able to add a discount to an offer that is then also declared (amount, text) | provide two text fields, the amount and the text. if the amount is filled, a text is mandatory.| 
| FR007              | Calculate the offer        | As a user, I want to have a "Calculate" button to see the price of the offer.                 | calculate the price with the following information: employee salary, timeframe (2/6 weeks). So the calculation of the project is like that: ((yearly salary of the employee + (sum of all costs from the table)) / 24) * timeframe --> cost of the given employee. sum that up for all employees in the project and then add the discount. the multiplier is for the failure rate because the projects are "success-only payment". and this risk must be decided upon the project by the person doing the offer. we can call it "risk-factor". |
| FR008              | Employee management        | As a user, I want to have a possibility to add, modify and delete employees separately        | On the startpage of the app itself, there should be a list of employees and then a form behind them to enter the information about them (name, role, salary). Role should be one of Principal, Senior, Professional, Junior |
| FR009              | Offer management           | As a user, I want to see all offers in progress.                                              | On the startpage of the app, list all open offers and have a button to reject them.                                         |
| FR010              | Rendering and uploading    | On the form for an offer, I want to have a button to render my offer into a PDF and upload it to Skribble | Rendering means that we will have a go template page which will render all the information we entered. we also need to render the requirements document (markdown) into a html and add it (the go template must have a placeholder for that). then we use API2PDF to render a PDF for this all. After that we upload it to Skribble via API and link the skribble upload. |
| FR011              | Client Mail                | I want to be able to add some context for the client before sending the email                 | Allow to enter our own information in Skribble for the email that is sent to the client. Also make sure to keep track on the application about the skribble progress and have a placeholder where the client can sign the document. |
